# React Effects and Fetch: ISS Tracker

This application aims to provide real-time information about the current location of the International Space Station (ISS). Users can access the app to view the precise coordinates and possibly additional details about the ISS's position. The functionality will be implemented using React, with a focus on honing skills related to the useEffect hook. This hook will likely be employed to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching live ISS location data, ensuring that the displayed information is always up-to-date. The end result is an interactive and dynamic app that offers users an engaging way to track the ISS's movements in real-time.
